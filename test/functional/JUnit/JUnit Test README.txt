We were able to get some test cases done through JUnit for both the Food and Item classes. With the specifications in mind we
were able to get 100% passed tests. However, it should be noted that we were not able to test everything else in the test
case specifications because we were unable to assert anything through JUnit as the majority of our methods and functions include
scan functions which make testing via JUnit extremely difficult if not impossible.
